# QXmindParser
it is a single parser file that parses the Xmind file into a clean json.
I have been using Xmind for a whole year, and I am a paid account. 
However, this software is known for its closed environment. And I found https://Xmind.work, disallow chinese accounts to log-in.
I have to find an alternative software to replace it to provide better cloud services and looser policies for chinese users.

## Usages
```bash
$ path/to/QXmindParser.exe path/to/your_xmind_file.xmind
```
